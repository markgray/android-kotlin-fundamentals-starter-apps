     * Called to have the fragment instantiate its user interface view. We initialize our
     * [FragmentGdgListBinding] variable `val binding` to the binding object that the method
     * [FragmentGdgListBinding.inflate] returns when it uses our [LayoutInflater] parameter
     * [inflater] to inflate our layout file layout/fragment_gdg_list.xml into an instance of
     * [FragmentGdgListBinding]. We set the `LifecycleOwner` of `binding` to `this` and set the
     * `viewModel` variable of `binding` to our [GdgListViewModel] field [viewModel]. We set our
     * [GdgListAdapter] variable `val adapter` to an instance constructed to use a [GdgClickListener]
     * whose lambda argument uses the `GdgChapter` parameter passed it in `chapter` to create an
     * [Uri] for the `website` UriString field of `chapter` to initialize variable `val destination`,
     * and starts an activity with an [Intent] whose activity is [Intent.ACTION_VIEW] and whose
     * Intent data URI is `destination`.
     *
     * Having constructed `adapter` we set the adapter of the `RecyclerView` in our layout file
     * whose resource ID is R.id.gdg_chapter_list (aka the `gdgChapterList` property of `binding`)
     * to `adapter`.
     *
     * We set an [Observer] on the `showNeedLocation` [LiveData] wrapped [Boolean] property of
     * [viewModel] whose lambda shows a [Snackbar] when that property transitions to `true` (the
     * [Snackbar] asks the user to enable location in the settings app). We set an [Observer] on
     * the `regionList` [LiveData] wrapped list of [String] property of [viewModel] whose lambda
     * overrides the `onChanged` method with a method which returns having done nothing is its
     * [List] of [String] parameter `data` is `null`. Otherwise it constructs [Chip] widgets for
     * every [String] in the `data` [List] whose text and tag are both that string, sets the
     * chip's `OnCheckedChangeListener` to a lambda which calls the `onFilterChanged` method
     * of [viewModel] with the tag and the `isChecked` status of the chip. When done creating
     * the chips the `onChanged` override removes all views from the `regionList` `ChipGroup`
     * property of `binding` and then loops adding each of the [Chip] widgets we just created
     * to the `regionList` `ChipGroup`.
     *
     * The last things that our [onCreateView] override has to do is to call [setHasOptionsMenu]
     * with `true` to report that this fragment would like to participate in populating the options
     * menu, and then to return the outermost [View] in the layout file associated with `binding`
     * to the caller.
     *
     * @param inflater The [LayoutInflater] object that can be used to inflate layout XML files.
     * @param container If non-null, this is the parent view that the fragment's
     * UI will be attached to. The fragment should not add the view itself,
     * but this can be used to generate the LayoutParams of the view.
     * @param savedInstanceState If non-null, this fragment is being re-constructed
     * from a previous saved state as given here.
